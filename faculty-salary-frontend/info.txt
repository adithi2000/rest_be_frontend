TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other object-oriented features like interfaces, classes, and decorators. This allows developers to catch errors earlier during development (compile time) rather than when the code is running (runtime).
Basics of TypeScript
TypeScript code is written in .ts files and must be compiled into standard JavaScript (.js files) using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) before it can be executed by a browser or Node.js runtime.
Key Features:
Type Annotations: Explicitly defining the type of a variable, function parameter, or return value using a colon (:).
Compilation: The process of converting TypeScript code into JavaScript code using the compiler.
Tooling Support: Excellent support in modern IDEs (like VS Code) for auto-completion, intelligent refactoring, and real-time error checking.
Variables in TypeScript
Variables are used to store data. TypeScript adds the ability to assign a specific type to a variable, ensuring the data stored is always of that kind.
Declaring Variables
You use let and const (same as modern JavaScript) to declare variables:
typescript
let username: string = "Alice";
const api_url: string = "https://api.example.com";
Use code with caution.

Basic Data Types
TypeScript includes all JavaScript primitive types and adds useful others:
Type
Description
Example
number	Floating point values (integers are also numbers).	let age: number = 25;
string	Textual data.	let name: string = "Bob";
boolean	True or false values.	let isActive: boolean = true;
any	A type that can hold any kind of value (use sparingly).	let data: any = 10; data = "new value";
array	An ordered list of values of a specific type.	let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
Methods (Functions) in TypeScript
Functions in TypeScript work much like JavaScript functions, but you can explicitly define the types of parameters and the type of the value the function returns. In an object-oriented context, a function defined within a class is called a method.
Defining Functions/Methods
Type annotations make function signatures clear and robust:
typescript
// Define parameter types (number, number) and return type (number)
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

const result = add(5, 10); // Result is inferred as a number
Use code with caution.

Optional and Default Parameters
You can make parameters optional using a question mark (?) or assign default values:
typescript
// 'greeting' has a default value
function greet(name: string, greeting: string = "Hello"): string {
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

// 'age' is optional
function introduce(name: string, age?: number): string {
    if (age !== undefined) {
        return `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
    }
    return `My name is ${name}.`;
}
Use code with caution.

Arrow Functions (Lambda Functions)
Modern syntax for defining functions, also fully type-safe:
typescript
const multiply = (x: number, y: number): number => {
    return x * y;
};
Use code with caution.
